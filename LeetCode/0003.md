             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

```

#### A

```js

 const lengthOfLongestSubstring = s => {
  const map = {}
  let left = 0

  return s.split('').reduce((max, v, i) => {
    left = map[v] >= left ? map[v] + 1 : left
    map[v] = i
    return Math.max(max, i - left + 1)
  }, 0)

}

```
