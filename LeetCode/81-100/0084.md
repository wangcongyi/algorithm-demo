#### Q

```

给定 n 个非负整数，用来表示柱状图中各个柱子的高度。每个柱子彼此相邻，且宽度为 1 。

求在该柱状图中，能够勾勒出来的矩形的最大面积。

```

#### A

```js

const largestRectangleArea = heights => {
  let maxArea = 0
  const stack = []
  // Append shadow rectangle (height = 0) to both side
  heights = [0].concat(heights).concat([0])
  for (let i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {
    /**
     *  Check if height of last element in the stack bigger than height at current position
     *  Position in stack always smaller than current position at least 1
     *  For example we have heights array [2,5,6,2]
     *   1: Add shadow rectangle to array => [0,2,5,6,2,0]
     *   2:
     *      Expression: heights[stack[stack.length - 1]] > heights[i]
     *      i = 0 => stack = [0],
     *      i = 1 => heights[0] > heights[1] (0 > 2) => false => stack = [0,1]
     *      i = 2 => heights[1] > heights[2] (2 > 5) => false => stack = [0,1,2]
     *      i = 3 => heights[2] > heights[3] (5 > 6) => false => stack = [0,1,2,3]
     *      i = 4 => heights[3] > heights[4] (6 > 2) => true
     *   3: Because the previous height bigger than the current height (6 > 2) so that we can confirm that the next rectangle
     *      will only shrink area. Let calculate the result
     *      First we get the position from the stack and assign to variable "j" from original stack = [0,1,2,3]
     *      Expression: (i - stack[stack.length - 1] - 1) * heights[j]
     *       j = 3 => stack = [0,1,2] => (i - stack[3 - 1] - 1) *  => (4 - 2 - 1) * 6 = 6
     *      Explain:
     *      - We need to calculate area backward so that we take i - last stack (4 - 2) and because we already
     *      get a value from stack before so that we need to subtract 1 => (4 - 2 - 1)
     *      - The latest position in stack is the maximum height we can get (j = 3 => heights[3] = 6)
     *       => Area calculate equal (4 - 2 - 1) * 6 = 6 (1 bar)
     *      - Compare with the current max area (currently 0) => New max area = 6
     *
     *      Expression: heights[stack[stack.length - 1]] > heights[i] | stack = [0,1,2]
     *      heights[2] > heights[4] (5 > 2) => true
     *      j = 2 => stack = [0, 1] => (i - stack[2 - 1] - 1) * 5 => (4 - 1 - 1) * 5 = 10
     *      Area > MaxArea (10 > 6) => New max area = 10 (2 bar)
     *      Explain: Because the height in stack are sorted (We stop add position to stack if the next height is lower)
     *
     *      heights[1] > heights[4] (2 > 2) => false | stack = [0,1,2]
     *      Keep running and the final answer it is the max area you need
     */
    while (stack && heights[stack[stack.length - 1]] > heights[i]) {
      const j = stack.pop()
      maxArea = Math.max((i - stack[stack.length - 1] - 1) * heights[j], maxArea)
    }
    stack.push(i)
  }
  return maxArea
